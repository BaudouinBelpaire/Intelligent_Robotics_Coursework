This coursework delves into the programing of a line follower and obstacle avoidance algorithms for an e-puck robot simulated on WeBot. From a given map, and two different paths marked on the floor, the robot had to follow it while selecting the correct one according to the initial beacon's signal. Thus, to achieve the goal, two different algorithms were developed using Behaviour-Based Robotics (BBR) and Evolutionary Robotics (ER) methods. The BBR method involves the development of a algorithm based on IF/ELSE conditions to drive the robot from the sensors. Whereas, the ER method relies on a Neural Network (NN) trying to optimise the solution by finding the best parameters to control the robot to the goal from the sensors values.
